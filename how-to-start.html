                                    <p>This is where things get exciting…</p>

                                    <p>Ethereum is basically a software platform, like Microsoft Windows or macOS. But online. The goal of Ethereum is to allow people to build decentralized applications on top of the Ethereum platform.</p>

                                    <p>So it would be like when Dropbox builds an app on top of macOS. Dropbox hosts your files, in exchange for a monthly hosting fee. On the Ethereum network, the fee for a similar storage service is paid in Ether, instead of US Dollars or British Pounds.</p>

                                    <p>The difference between Ethereum and current web application solutions is that these apps (and the currency) are open to everyone, free from censorship and much more secure than existing solutions. This is because Ethereum apps are decentralized.</p>

                                    <p>What makes these apps decentralized?</p>

                                    <p>The network is built on a database that is hosted on many computers around the world. Each computer has a copy of the database and multiple computers have to agree on a change to the database, before it is implemented.</p>

                                    <p>Although everyone stores this data, you need to have a special password (or a private key) to unlock your data. The private key is as close to unhackable as you can get in the online world, so the data is probably even more secure than if you stored it on a cloud-based service.</p>

                                    <p>This database is called a blockchain.</p>

                        <h3>What is Ethereum?</h3>
                        <div class="question-block">
                            <p>This is where things get exciting…</p>

                            <p>Ethereum is basically a software platform, like Microsoft Windows or macOS. But online. The goal of Ethereum is to allow people to build decentralized applications on top of the Ethereum platform.</p>

                            <p>So it would be like when Dropbox builds an app on top of macOS. Dropbox hosts your files, in exchange for a monthly hosting fee. On the Ethereum network, the fee for a similar storage service is paid in Ether, instead of US Dollars or British Pounds.</p>

                            <p>The difference between Ethereum and current web application solutions is that these apps (and the currency) are open to everyone, free from censorship and much more secure than existing solutions. This is because Ethereum apps are decentralized.</p>

                            <p>What makes these apps decentralized?</p>

                            <p>The network is built on a database that is hosted on many computers around the world. Each computer has a copy of the database and multiple computers have to agree on a change to the database, before it is implemented.</p>

                            <p>Although everyone stores this data, you need to have a special password (or a private key) to unlock your data. The private key is as close to unhackable as you can get in the online world, so the data is probably even more secure than if you stored it on a cloud-based service.</p>

                            <p>This database is called a blockchain.</p>
